# Troubleshooting for creating apps
{: #managingapps}

General problems with creating applications might include apps that can't be updated, or double-byte characters that aren't displayed. In many cases, you can recover from these problems by following a few easy steps.
{:shortdesc}

## My apps are hosted in different domains
{: #domains-ts}
{: troubleshoot}

Some of my apps are hosted in the `mybluemix.net` domain, but others are hosted in the `appdomain.cloud` domain.

My existing apps are hosted in the `mybluemix.net` domain, but my newer apps are hosted in the `appdomain.cloud` domain.
{: tsSymptoms}

A new host name option `*.appdomain.cloud` is available on cloud.ibm.com.

Previously, the `mybluemix.net` domain was used for hosting apps in various deployment targets, such as {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} or Cloud Foundry. Any apps that you have hosted on `mybluemix.net` are not impacted.

The subdomain for Cloud Foundry apps is `cf.appdomain.cloud`. The subdomain for apps that you deploy to {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} is `containers.appdomain.cloud`.

For more information, see [Managing your domains](/docs/apps?topic=creating-apps-update-domain).

## You have unsaved changes
{: #ts_unsaved_changes}
{: troubleshoot}

When you click items on the app details page, you might not be able to perform any actions. You also might be prompted to save changes before you can continue.

When you try to check your app or services on the app details page, the following error message is displayed:
{: tsSymptoms}

`You have unsaved changes. Are you sure you want to leave this page?`

When you scroll your mouse over the **INSTANCES** or **MEMORY QUOTA** fields on the runtime pane, the values change. This behavior is by design. However, you're prompted to save the memory or instance settings before you go to another page.
{: tsCauses}

Close the message window, and click **RESET** in your runtime pane.
{: tsResolve}

## Can't access {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services because of authorization errors
{: #ts_vcap}
{: troubleshoot}

Authorization errors might occur when your app accesses an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service, if the service credentials are hardcoded in your app.

After you configure your app to communicate with an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service, you deploy the app to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. However, you can't use the app to access the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service and receive an authorization error.
{: tsSymptoms}

The hardcoded credentials in the app might not be correct. Every time that the service is re-created, the credentials to access it change.
{: tsCauses}

Instead of hardcoding the credentials in your app, use connection parameters from the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable. The methods to use connection parameters from the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable vary depending on program languages. For example, for Node.js apps, you can use the following command:
{: tsResolve}

```
process.env.VCAP_SERVICES
```

For more information about the commands that you can use in other program languages, see [Java](https://docs.run.pivotal.io/buildpacks/java/java-tips.html#env-var){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") and [Ruby](https://docs.run.pivotal.io/buildpacks/ruby/ruby-tips.html#env-var){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").

## 502 Bad Gateway errors are received
{: #ts_502_error}
{: troubleshoot}

If you receive `502 Bad Gateway` errors when you interact with apps on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, check the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} status page, and then take appropriate actions.

You receive error messages that start with 502 Bad Gateway. For example, you might see `502 Bad Gateway: Registered endpoint failed to handle the request.`
{: tsSymptoms}

A Bad Gateway error usually happens when you go to a website that uses a proxy server to store and relay the data from the main server that hosts the site. The main server and the proxy server might not connect properly. Then, you see the HTTP status code 502 in your browser window. This status code indicates that the site's main server didn't receive the HTTP implementation that it expected from the proxy server.
{: tsCauses}

Other less common causes of a Bad Gateway error are internet service provider (ISP) dropouts, bad firewall configurations, and browser cache errors.

If you suspect that an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service is down, first check the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} status](https://cloud.ibm.com/status){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") page. A workaround might be to [use the service in another {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region](/docs/resources/connect_external_app?topic=resources-externalapp){: new_window}. If the service status is normal, try the following steps to solve the problem:
{: tsResolve}

  * Retry the action:
    * Reload the page by pressing F5 on your keyboard, or by clicking **Refresh**. If this step doesn't work, clear your browser's cache and cookies, and then reload again.
    * Use a different browser.
    * Restart your router, your modem, and your computer. Rebooting these devices can clear up various errors that lead to the error 502.
  * Wait and try again later. Temporary problems might occur with your internet service provider or the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services. You can wait until the temporary problems are solved.
  * If the problem still exists, contact {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support. See [Contacting {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") for more information.

## Android apps can't receive {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}
{: #ts_push}
{: troubleshoot}

Android apps in certain regions where Google isn't accessible can't receive notifications that you send out through the IBM {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service. In this case, a workaround is to use third-party services.

You bind a {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} app and send a message to the registered devices. However, apps that are developed on Android can't receive your notifications in certain regions.
{: tsSymptoms}

IBM {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service uses the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service to dispatch notifications to mobile apps that are developed on Android. To enable the Android apps to receive notifications, Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service must be accessible by the mobile apps. In regions where the Android apps can't reach the GCM service, the Android apps can't receive {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}.
{: tsCauses}

As a workaround, use third-party services that don't rely on the GCM service, for example, [Pushy](https://pushy.me/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon"), and [jpush](https://www.jiguang.cn/en/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").
{: tsResolve}

## Double-byte characters aren't displayed properly when apps are pushed to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #ts_doublebytes}
{: troubleshoot}

Double-byte characters might not be displayed properly if Unicode support isn't configured properly for the servlet or JSP files.

When an app is pushed to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, the double-byte characters that are specified within the app aren't displayed properly.
{: tsSymptoms}

The problem might occur if Unicode support isn't configured properly for the servlet or JSP files.
{: tsCauses}

You can use the following code in your servlet or JSP file:
{: tsResolve}

  * In the servlet source file
  ```java
	response.setContentType("text/html; charset=UTF-8");
	```
  {: codeblock}

  * In the JSP
  ```jsp
	<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
	```
  {: codeblock}

## Node.js apps can't be deployed
{: #ts_nodejs_deploy}
{: troubleshoot}

You might experience problems when you update a Node.js app or deploy a Node.js app to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

When you update a Node.js app or deploy your Node.js app to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you might see one of the following error messages:
{: tsSymptoms}

`An app was not successfully detected by any available buildpack.`

`Instance (index 0) failed to start accepting connections.`

`Cannot get instances since staging failed.`

Possible causes are as follows:
{: tsCauses}

  * The start command isn't specified.
  * Files that are required to deploy a Node.js app are either missing from the app or in a folder other than the root directory.

Use one of the following methods, depending on the cause of the problem:
{: tsResolve}

  * Specify the start command by one of the following methods:
     * Use the Cloud Foundry command line interface. For example:
      ```
		  ibmcloud cf push MyUniqueNodejs01 -p app_path -c "node app.js"
		  ```
      {: codeblock}

    * Use the [package.json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonfile){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") file. For example:
	    ```json
		  {
        ...
  	    "scripts": {
	 		  "start": "node app.js"
 	    }
	    }
	    ```

    * Use the `manifest.yml` file. For example:
	    ```
		  applications:
      name: MyUniqueNodejs01
      ...
      command: node app.js
      ...
      ```

  * Ensure that a `package.json` file exists in your Node.js app so that the Node.js buildpack can recognize the app. Ensure that this file is in the root directory of your app.
    The following example shows a simple `package.json` file:
	```json
	{
        "name": "MyUniqueNodejs01",
        "version": "0.0.1",
        "description": "A sample package.json file",
        "dependencies": {
                "express": "3.4.x",
                "jade": "1.1.x"
        },
        "engines": {
                "node": "0.10.x"
        },
        "scripts": {
                  "start": "node app.js"
        }
 }
    ```

## Configuration errors appear in the `server.xml` file after you import an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Liberty app into Eclipse
{: #ts_eclipse}
{: troubleshoot}

If you see configuration errors in the `server.xml` file after you import an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Liberty app into Eclipse, you might need to remove the `server.xml` file from the project.

After you import an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Liberty app into Eclipse, you see configuration errors within the `server.xml` file from Eclipse Problems view.
{: tsSymptoms}

Liberty buildpack uses the `server.xml` file to configure the app and generates a `runtime-vars.xml` file when the Liberty app is pushed to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. When you import the app to Eclipse, the `runtime-vars.xml` file doesn't exist in your local environment.
{: tsCauses}

You can resolve this problem by removing the server.xml file from the project. The buildpack creates the `server.xml` file dynamically when you push the app as a WAR app. For more information, see [Liberty for Java](/docs/runtimes/liberty?topic=liberty-liberty_runtime#liberty_runtime).
{: tsResolve}

## Apps can't be staged by using custom buildpacks
{: #ts_bp_compilation}
{: troubleshoot}

You might not be able to deploy an app to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} with a custom buildpack if the scripts in the buildpack aren't executable files.

When you deploy an app to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} with a custom buildpack, you see the error message, `The application failed to stage, so there are no instances to display.`
{: tsSymptoms}

This problem might happen if scripts, such as the detect script, the compile script, and the release script, aren't executable.
{: tsCauses}

You can use the [Git update](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") command to change the permission of each script to executable. For example, you can type `git update --chmod=+x script.sh`.
{: tsResolve}

## Can't deploy an app from the Delivery Pipeline in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Continuous Delivery
{: #ts_devops_to_bm}
{: troubleshoot}

 You might not be able to deploy your app with the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} in {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} if the `manifest.yml` file isn't present in your app.

 When you deploy an app with the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} in {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}, an error message `Unable to detect a supported application type` might display.
 {: tsSymptoms}

 This problem might happen because the pipeline requires a `manifest.yml` file to deploy an app to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
 {: tsCauses}

 To resolve this problem, you must create a `manifest.yml` file. For more information about how to create a `manifest.yml` file, see [Application manifest](/docs/cloud-foundry?topic=cloud-foundry-deploy_apps#appmanifest).
 {: tsResolve}

## Exceeded your storage quota
{: #exceed_quota}

If the build or deploy jobs fail, and you see the following message, you can delete your images with the following CLI commands. `Status: unauthorized: You have exceeded your storage quota. Delete one or more images, or review your storage quota and pricing plan.`

* Install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) if you don't already have it.
* Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using `ibmcloud login`, and point it to the space that you're in.
* List your images by using `ibmcloud cr images`.
* Delete any unused images by using `ibmcloud cr image-rm <respository>:<tag>`.
* Rerun the build or deploy job that failed.

## Accessing Kubernetes logs
{: #access_kube_logs}

If the app isn't running and you can't access the health endpoint, try looking at the logs in the cluster.
* Install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) if you don't already have it.
* Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using `ibmcloud login`, and point it to the space that you're in.
* List your clusters by using `ibmcloud cs clusters`,
* Point to your corresponding cluster by using `ibmcloud cs cluster-config <cluster-name>`.
* Export the environment variable that is listed.
* View your pods by using `kubectl get pods`. If you need to install `kubectl`, see [Install and set up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").
* You can view the logs in your app by using `kubectl logs <pod-name>.`

## Starting `docker` fails with file not found message
{: #docker_not_found}
{: troubleshoot}

When you try to start Docker, the following error message is displayed:
{: tsSymptoms}

```
An error exec: "docker": executable file not found in $PATH was encountered while the Docker image is building.
```
{: screen}

The Docker client isn't installed, or it's installed but not started.
{: tsCauses}
